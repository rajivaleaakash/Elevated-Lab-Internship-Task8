# Elevated-Lab-Internship-Task8
 Created a basic interactive dashboard that shows sales performance by product, region, and month.
# Superstore Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains the **Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard**
created in **Power BI**.\
The project demonstrates end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow,
including data preparation, modeling, DAX calculations, and
visualization.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard provides an interactive view of Superstore sales and
profitability, enabling stakeholders to: - Monitor **Sales, Profit, and
Quantity trends** - Analyze **performance by Category, Sub-Category, and
Region** - Identify **Top/Bottom performing products** - Compare
**Year-over-Year growth** - Drill down across **hierarchies (Category →
Sub-Category → Product)**

## 🛠️ Tools Used

-   **Power BI Desktop**
-   **Excel (Superstore.xlsx dataset)**

## 🔑 Key Features

-   Cleaned and transformed raw data in Power Query
-   Star schema model with **Fact (Sales)** and **Dimension (Products,
    Customers, Regions, Calendar)**
-   DAX measures for metrics such as:
    -   Total Sales
    -   Total Profit
    -   YoY Sales Growth %
-   Interactive visuals:
    -   Line chart (Sales and profit over Time)
    -   Funnal chart (Sales by Sub-Categories)
    -   Donnut chart (Sales by Regions)
    -   KPI Cards (Key Metrics)
-   Filters & Slicers (Category, Region, Time, Customer Segment)

## 📈 Insights You Can Derive

-   Sales trends across years and regions
-   Most profitable categories and subcategories
-   Regional performance (e.g., East vs. West)
-   YoY growth and profitability trends

## 📌 Future Enhancements

-   Add forecasting using Power BI analytics
-   Deploy dashboard to **Power BI Service** for sharing
-   Integrate with live database instead of static Excel
